** Charging
*** For development:
+ For the two WIFIBot *Without LiDAR*, use the charger to charge directly. 
+ For the WIFIBot *With LiDAR*, because it doesn't have the adapter inside, and the charge port *directly connected to the battery! (be aware of this, don't short the cable while it is connected to this port)*. So please use the DC Power supply to charge. Set *voltage to 16.8V*, maximum current can be set to 4A. This WIFIBot use 3 Li-ion Battery packs in parallel connection. Each Battery pack contains four 3.7V Li-ion cells in serial connection, so the battery pack mominal voltage is 14.8V, charge voltage is 16.8V. Check https://github.com/5355-ROStig/5355-Wibot-doc/blob/main/battery.pdf for more details about the battery pack.
